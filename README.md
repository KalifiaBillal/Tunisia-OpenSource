2. Modifying source code (technical)

## Code & Design The Website

You need some basic ability to use a terminal as well as some knowledge of web
development like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site is built with the following
programming tools:

- [Jekyll][jekyll]
- [Bootstrap][bootstrap]

### Installing

This step requires having a `ruby` development environment and `git` installed
and configured to connect to GitHub with SSH.

- [Installing Ruby][installing-ruby]
- [Using GitHub with SSH][github-ssh]

1. Install Jekyll using and other Ruby gems

```sh
sudo gem install bundler
```

2. Fork and clone the main website repository

```sh
git clone --single-branch --branch master https://github.com/opensourcedesign/opensourcedesign.github.io.git
cd opensourcedesign.github.io/
bundle install
```

3. Run our installer script

This will pull down all of the repositories (jobs, events, etc...) and put them
in there proper place to build our website locally.

```sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

*Note: you need to be a member of our [GitHub organization][osd-org].*

4. Build the static site & watch for files

```sh
bundler exec jekyll serve --watch --config _config.yml,_config-dev.yml
```
